# IAHolidayCalendar
Calendar that will display month data and make a network call to indicate the holidays in the shown month.

## How I am tackling the challenge
First, I will create the calendar UI (Using UIKit) and work on the calendar logic. I will use Swift's Calendar API to create the calendar logic - after the UI is set up, I will work on the networking layer.
